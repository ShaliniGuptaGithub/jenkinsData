Step 1.  Manage jenkins ==> Manage Users
Step 2.  Manage Jenkins ==> Configure Global Security ==> Security Realm ==> Jenkins Own User Database ==> Project Based Matrix
Step 3.  Job ==> Configure ==> General ==> Enable project based Security






Jenkins on http / https
-----------------------

You can enable Jenkin via HTTPS with following steps,

Step1: Create Certificate using java

keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias "localhost" -keystore "localhost.jks" -validity 365 -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=localhost, OU=OU_name, O=OU_name, L=city, ST=State_name, C=two_letter_country_code" -ext SAN=dns:localhost,ip:127.0.0.1 -storepass changeit

Step2: Export p12 Public Certificate from key-store file

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore "localhost.jks" -storepass changeit -destkeystore "localhost.p12" -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -deststorepass changeit

Step3: Host Jenkins using key-store (JKS) file

java -jar jenkins.war --httpsPort=8082 --httpPort=-1 --httpsKeyStore="/home/umesh/Desktop/localhost.jks" --httpsKeyStorePassword=changeit

Step4: Import the Certificate into Browser

You may have question like why we have exported p12 certificate...well, this certificate we are going to import into our browser where we access Jenkins. The same p12 certificate can be shared between multiple users. For example in Chrome go to Setting>Search - "Manage Certificate" and click on "Manage Certificate" you will get an "Certificate" window. Import the certificate into each tab (Personnel, Other People, Intermediate Certificate Authorities, Trusted Root Certification Authorities, Trusted Pubilshers and Untrusted Publishers)


===============================

openssl pkcs12 -inkey example.net.key -in example.net.pem -export -out keys.pkcs12

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keys.pkcs12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins.jks
